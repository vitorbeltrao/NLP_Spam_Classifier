There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using a text messages dataset to predict if a new message is spam or not. Also, I want to show and explore these big and interesting world of natural language processing.

Soon, I will be putting here a file with the deployment of this model!

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to this project and the dataset.
